Reflection on 404 Day: AI Day in Atlanta at City of Refuge
Presenter: Derek Davis

Today was a big and exciting day at City of Refuge—we celebrated 404 Day, also known as AI Day in Atlanta! 
This event was all about artificial intelligence (AI) and how we can use it in real life. 
Our presenter was Mr. Derek Davis, and he taught us so much about what AI can do. I was assigned to take notes for the session, and here’s everything I learned.

Session 1: AI Tools and Building with Prompts
We started by exploring different AI tools and apps that do amazing things.

ElevenLabs
This app lets you clone your voice. Imagine recording your voice once and then using AI to make it say other things!

We learned how to design a voice by giving a prompt—like “a Southern man with a slow, relaxed voice.”

You can change the voice tone, speed, and even language.

Midjourney
This tool makes images from words. For example, we typed:
“Ace Bailey dunking a basketball with defenders around him”
—and Midjourney turned that into a cool image!The images were not perfect but pretty impressive.

Other AI Tools We Explored:
HeyGen AI – makes talking avatars (animated characters that speak).

Replit – a platform to write code and test it online.

ChatGPT / Claude – AI helpers that can answer questions, write stories, help with code, and more.

Perplexity.ai – another smart research tool, great for finding deep info on a topic.

FuturePedia.io – like a Wikipedia for AI tools.

Building an AI App
Using Fireproof, we created an app and connected it to tools like Bolt.new, which builds real apps from prompts.

We asked AI to help build an app that could track basketball stats, design voices, or even create dashboards for learning styles.

Session 2: Learning Styles & Planning with AI
In the second session, we talked about how people learn differently and how AI can help.

Using AI to Learn Better:
We created a learning dashboard that tracks how we learn—like reading, listening, or watching videos.

AI gave us ideas on how to improve skills like subnetting in networking or studying for CompTIA Network+.

Tools for Learning:
Eduflow – a tool to track your learning sessions and goals.

ChatGPT and Perplexity – help build content, like quizzes, lessons, or audio books.

Voice design – for people who learn better by listening, we can build custom voices that teach lessons.

"Coffee and Claude" – we even created a fun voice script with a teacher introducing themselves on the first day of class!

Session 3: AI, Food, and Building More Tools
The final session was super creative. We built apps using food themes—yes, food!

AI + Food Example:
We created a recipe and restaurant guide for healthy eating in Atlanta, using tools like:

Claude.ai – to find top restaurants, prices, and menu items.

ElevenLabs – to create a voice character who talks like the vibe of the restaurant (e.g., young, Southern woman voice).

Midjourney – to make images of healthy food and Atlanta scenes.

HeyGen – to make avatars that talk about the food in a video.

Vibe Coding:
A new way of thinking about code using your own “vibe” or energy to guide how apps and tools are built.

Building Apps with AI:
Using tools like Replit, Bolt.new, and Fireproof, we created full apps just by giving AI the right instructions (called prompts).

Example: We built a “Dream Analytics App” that shows your dream meaning, astrology sign, and mood just from a few typed details.

Final Takeaways:
AI is like a super helper: You give it clear directions (prompts), and it builds, speaks, draws, or teaches for you.

You don’t need to be a coder: With the right tools and prompts, anyone can create powerful things.

Some tools are free, but others cost money—so we also talked about open-source (free) options.

Everything is faster with AI: Something that might take hours normally can be done in minutes using AI.

Suggestions:
Try using tools like ChatGPT or Claude to build something fun or useful.

Take your prompts from ChatGPT and research them more deeply in Perplexity.

Practice with tools like ElevenLabs, Midjourney, and Bolt.new.

Share what you build with others—community helps you grow!

Final Reflection:
404 Day was one of the most exciting events I’ve ever been a part of. Mr. Derek Davis did a great job showing us how AI isn’t just the future—it’s already here, and we can use it to learn better, build smarter, and create cool stuff. 
I learned that I don’t have to wait until I’m a tech expert—I can start building things now, just by learning how to ask AI the right questions.

I can’t wait to keep exploring, designing, and creating with the tools we learned today. AI is opening new doors, and I'm ready to walk through them!
