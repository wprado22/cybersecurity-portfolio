Learning How to Learn – Cybersecurity Basics with Adam Bricks

Today, I had the pleasure of attending another insightful class with Adam Bricks at the City of Refuge. The focus of the lesson was "Learn How to Learn", a concept that emphasizes not just acquiring knowledge but actively applying it in daily life.

We started by reflecting on the things that are important to us and how we can take deliberate steps to put them into action. Learning is only valuable when we apply it—so the key question is: What will I do to implement what I learned today?

Today's lesson was on the basics of cybersecurity, an essential topic in our digital world. One of the first and most crucial takeaways was the importance of using a password manager. Instead of struggling to remember multiple passwords—or worse, using weak, repetitive ones—password managers provide a secure and convenient way to store and manage them.

Moving forward, I plan to:

Set up a reliable password manager and update my passwords for better security.
Share this knowledge with family and friends to help them stay protected online.
Continue learning about cybersecurity best practices to enhance my understanding and preparedness.
Learning is a journey, but action is what truly drives progress. Today’s lesson reinforced that knowledge is only as good as what we do with it.
