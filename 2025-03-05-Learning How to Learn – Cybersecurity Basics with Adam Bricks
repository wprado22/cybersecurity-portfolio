Learning How to Learn – Cybersecurity & Atomic Habits
Today, I had the pleasure of attending another insightful class with Adam Bricks at the City of Refuge. The focus was on two key areas: cybersecurity basics and the power of building good habits for success.

Cybersecurity Basics
Cybersecurity is about protecting personal and professional information. Today’s key takeaways:

Use a Password Manager – A secure way to store strong, unique passwords.
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – Adds extra security by requiring more than just a password.
Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) – Hides your internet activity from hackers.
End-to-End Email Encryption – Keeps emails private and secure.
Run Security Agents on Your Devices – Examples include Falcon, Discover, and CrowdStrike, which detect and stop cyber threats.
Beyond technology, Adam emphasized four key principles for success:

Be Prompt – Show up on time.
Be Prepared – Plan ahead and do the work.
Be Present – Stay focused and engaged.
Have the Will to Perform – Follow through with action.
Excellence is Not a Part-Time Job
Adam reminded us that excellence requires full commitment. Just like we protect our own information, we must also be responsible for keeping our employer’s data safe.

The Power of Atomic Habits
We also explored how small, consistent improvements lead to massive success:

You are your habits – What you do daily shapes who you become.
1% Better Every Day – Small improvements compound into big results.
Stay Focused – Avoid distractions and maintain clarity, like an airplane radar scanning for its target.
Putting It into Action
* Today, I will review what I learned so that I can teach an 8th grader—explaining cybersecurity in simple terms will help me solidify my knowledge.

* To build better habits, I will:

Wake up at 5 AM every day to ensure I get to class on time.
Join a cybersecurity group and dedicate 3-5 hours per week to learning AI and cybersecurity.
Use a habit tracker and calendar schedule to stay consistent.
Stick to foundational habits like brushing my teeth and drinking water before bed.
Final Thoughts
Learning is only valuable when put into action. What will I do today to move forward? I will teach what I learned to someone else—because if I can explain it simply, I truly understand it.
