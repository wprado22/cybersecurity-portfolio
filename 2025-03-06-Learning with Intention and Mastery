Reflection on Today’s Lesson – Learning with Intention & Mastery
Today’s class was another deep dive into learning how to learn, led by our coach, Adam Bricker. The key takeaway? We are the stories we tell ourselves. If we want to shape our future, we must be intentional about what we learn, how we apply it, and the habits we build.

The Process of Learning & Mastery
To truly master a skill, we must approach learning with structure:

Daily reminders (inspired by Robert Greene’s The 48 Laws of Power).
Reading as a habit – Farming Street method: read every day and every week.
Podcasts for continuous learning – The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish, The Art of Manliness, Andrew Huberman, cybersecurity and AI podcasts.
Taking notes & drawing visuals while listening – Helps retain key concepts.
Learning in the morning, applying in the evening – The best way to reinforce knowledge.
Teaching an 8th grader – If I can explain it simply, I truly understand it.
Tracking trends in AI and cybersecurity – Comparing past and present trends to impress in interviews.
Three Forms of Learning
To improve retention, we must tell ourselves, “This is important.” The brain is wired to remember what we prioritize. Learning happens in three ways:

Building – Actively creating knowledge by applying what we learn.
Redacting – Filtering out unnecessary information to focus on what truly matters.
Growing – Expanding our understanding by challenging ourselves and improving over time.
Mindfulness & Learning
A key technique discussed today was mindfulness meditation—being fully present in the moment. One exercise was to count both your heart rate and breath rate at the same time, which enhances focus and awareness. This practice can also be applied to learning:

Stay present when absorbing new information.
Train your brain to recognize what’s valuable.
Replace bad habits by consciously building good ones.
Building a Cybersecurity Career
To work remotely in cybersecurity, I must develop high-demand skills and stay updated. Steps to take:
✅ Follow industry leaders – Coursera’s founder, Jason Dion, Professor Messer.
✅ Create a personal website – Upload cybersecurity content, including 10+ videos, as proof of knowledge.
✅ Join cybersecurity communities – Engage in discussions, ask questions, and learn from peers.
✅ Research companies before interviews – Understand their weaknesses and bring solutions.
✅ Prepare strong interview questions – What is the company doing wrong? How can I innovate?

Developing Strong Habits & Focus
Success is not about luck; it’s about trusting the process and building disciplined habits:

Avoid distractions – Multitasking kills productivity. Ask: What am I being distracted from?
Essential life skill: Curiosity – What should I know? What questions should I ask?
Training my brain – Find something obvious but surprising every day.
Problem-solving mindset – Why wasn’t this invented earlier? What’s a better way to solve it?
Routines & Productivity Hacks
To stay focused and productive, I will:
✅ Block out fake meetings – Pencil in time to relax and move my body.
✅ Organize my space – A clean workspace leads to a clear mind.
✅ Create a structured routine – Not fighting nature, but working with it.
✅ Turn values into time – Schedule relationships, work syncs, and deep focus time.
✅ Hack back distractions – Manage emails, group chats, and digital clutter.

Overcoming Mental Barriers
Many people don’t succeed because they are not hyper-specific about their goals. I need to avoid:
🚫 Ego depletion – Wasting mental energy on unnecessary decisions.
🚫 Inner critic & imposter syndrome – Trust my knowledge and progress.
🚫 Distractions – Stay committed to my path.

The Power of Discipline & Mentorship
Book recommendation: The Power of Discipline by Daniel Walter – The best gift I will give my future self.
Good habits replace bad habits – I don’t break old habits; I replace them with better ones.
I am the average of the five people I spend the most time with – Who are the five people I want to learn from?
Challenging My Own Perspective
Adam also introduced a thought-provoking idea:
What information should be released to prove me wrong?
This mindset encourages critical thinking and helps ensure that beliefs are based on facts, not assumptions.

The 7 Steps of Creating Your Own Story
Success is not just about learning—it’s about shaping our personal and professional narrative. By setting clear goals and objectives, we take control of our learning journey. The key is to:

Define what success looks like.
Identify the habits that support it.
Test and practice what we’ve learned.
Moving Forward
Today’s lesson was a reminder that learning how to learn is one of the most valuable skills I can develop. I will:
✅ Be intentional about my learning process.
✅ Practice mindfulness to improve focus.
✅ Replace bad habits with positive actions.
✅ Test myself regularly to reinforce new knowledge.

A mountain is built through a process—brick by brick, habit by habit, decision by decision. The journey to mastering cybersecurity—and any skill—starts with deliberate practice and the right mindset. Today, I took another step forward.
