Reflection on Today’s Class – Core Values, Motivation, and Accountability
Today’s class with Instructor Ron Cofield and guest speaker Paul Farley was filled with important lessons about personal growth, accountability, and professional success. Below is a breakdown of what we covered, explained in a way that an 8th grader can easily understand.

Core Values & What Drives Us
We started by talking about core values—the beliefs and principles that guide our decisions and actions. Think of core values like the rules of a video game. If you want to win, you need to follow the right strategies.

* Values – The things that matter most to you in life, like honesty, hard work, or kindness.

Example: If you value honesty, you will always tell the truth, even when it’s hard.
* Drivers – The things that push you to take action.

Example: A basketball player might be driven by the desire to win championships.
* Motivation – The reason why you keep going, even when things are tough.

Example: A student who wants to become a doctor is motivated to study hard, even when the homework is difficult.
* Proactive vs. Reactive Thinking

Proactive people take control of their lives and plan ahead.
Example: A student who studies a little every day before a test is proactive.
Reactive people wait for things to happen before taking action.
Example: A student who only studies the night before a test is being reactive.
* Instructor Ron Cofield recommended the book "7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey to help us become more proactive and successful.

The Gift of Accountability – "Taking the Punch"
Guest speaker Paul Farley shared a powerful lesson about accountability, which means taking responsibility for your actions, even when things go wrong.

* Accountability – Owning up to your mistakes instead of blaming others.

Example: If you break a window while playing soccer, accountability means telling the owner instead of running away.
Paul called it "the gift of accountability" because taking responsibility helps us learn and grow. He also said that sometimes we have to “take the punch”, meaning we have to face the consequences of our actions and learn from them.

* Example in Real Life:
Imagine you and your friend are working on a school project, but you didn’t do your part. If the project gets a bad grade, you can either:

Blame your friend and say it wasn’t your fault (not accountable).
Take responsibility, admit that you didn’t do your part, and learn to manage your time better next time (accountability).
Paul’s message was clear: Owning up to mistakes makes you stronger, more respected, and a better leader.

Final Thoughts
Today’s class taught me that success isn’t just about skills—it’s also about values, mindset, and taking responsibility. Whether it’s in school, work, or personal life, being proactive and accountable will help me grow.

Next Steps:
* I will start being more proactive by planning my daily tasks ahead of time.
* I will take accountability for my mistakes instead of blaming others.
* I will look into "7 Habits of Highly Effective People" to build better habits.

This was an inspiring class, and I’m excited to apply these lessons in my own journey!
