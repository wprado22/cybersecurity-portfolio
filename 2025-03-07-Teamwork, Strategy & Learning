Final Class with Adam Bricks – Teamwork, Strategy & Learning
Today marked the last class with Instructor Adam Bricks at the City of Refuge, and it was packed with valuable lessons on teamwork, strategy, and personal growth.

What Makes a World-Class Team?
At the beginning of class, we discussed what it takes to build a world-class team. We explored the top 5, 6, or 7 key qualities that make teams highly effective, such as communication, adaptability, trust, leadership, shared goals, and resilience.

The SpaceTeam Game – Learning Through Experience
To put our teamwork skills to the test, we played a game called SpaceTeam. My group consisted of five people—four players and one person hosting the hotspot, as we needed to be on the same network.

First Attempt: Finding Our Flow
In the first round, we each played on our own phones, shouting out the gears we needed to click to advance. However, we struggled due to technical difficulties at the start. After receiving some guidance, we began again. Though we were open to suggestions and tried a new approach—placing all our phones together so we could see each other's instructions—we still couldn’t pass Level 2.

Second Attempt: Adjusting Strategy & Improving Performance
After discussing our experience in class, we were given a second chance to play. This time, we adjusted our strategy:
✅ We split into two smaller groups.
✅ Instead of just shouting instructions, we focused on each other's screens and pressed the correct buttons for each other.

By working more collaboratively and thinking strategically, we made it all the way to Level 6! We then shared our new strategy with the rest of our team, proving that breaking into smaller, focused groups improved our performance.

Lessons on Burnout & Workplace Efficiency
Back in class, Adam led a discussion on burnout in the workplace and how different people recover in different ways. He introduced the Rule of 3, which helps manage crisis situations by handling just one at a time in daily life. Additionally, he emphasized the importance of clear agreements between team members to ensure mutual understanding and expectations.

The Power of Storytelling & Personal Branding
Adam also touched on the importance of storytelling in professional settings. We discussed:

The "2-Minute Life Story" technique – A way to make yourself memorable in conversations.
LinkedIn Learning Assignment – Learning how to effectively tell your story.
Key Takeaways from the Class
No Rules in Asymmetric War – Like the SpaceTeam game, where we had to create our own strategies, real-world challenges often don’t have clear rules—we must adapt.
Defend, Attack, Be Resilient – A mindset applicable to both cybersecurity and life.
Escape Room for Cybersecurity – A fun but competitive exercise where hiring decisions were based on who paid attention to the presenter, reinforcing the value of focus and engagement.
Final Thoughts & Reminders
As the class wrapped up, we were reminded to:
✔ Dress in business casual for Wednesday.
✔ Arrive early to complete the class QR code check-in.
✔ Prioritize reading books over quick articles, as books take years of expertise to develop, while articles are often written in just hours.
✔ Complete the instructor review to provide feedback on the course.

Today’s class was a great reminder that success comes from teamwork, adaptability, and continuous learning. The lessons I’ve learned will stick with me far beyond the classroom.
