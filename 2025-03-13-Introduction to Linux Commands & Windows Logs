Reflection on Today’s Class – Introduction to Linux Commands & Windows Logs
Today’s class with Mr. Darryl Davis was a deep dive into the basics of Linux commands, the Linux shell, and Windows log files. We learned how to navigate and interact with a Linux system using the command-line interface (CLI). Below is a breakdown of today’s lesson, explained in a way that an 8th grader can understand.

What is Linux?
🔹 Linux is an operating system—just like Windows or macOS—but it is free and open-source, meaning anyone can modify and share it. It is widely used for servers, cybersecurity, and programming.

🔹 The Kernel is like the brain of Linux—it controls the computer’s hardware and software.

Linux Shell & Terminal
📌 Terminal vs. Shell

The terminal is like a TV screen—it displays what we type and shows results.
The shell is like a translator—it takes the commands we type and tells the computer what to do.
📌 Types of Linux Shells:

Bourne Shell (sh) – One of the oldest shell types.
Bourne Again Shell (bash) – The most commonly used shell in Linux today.
C Shell (csh) – Designed for programmers.
✅ To check which shell you are using, type:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo $SHELL
Example output: /bin/bash

Basic Linux Commands
1️⃣ Navigation & Viewing Files
🔹 ls – Lists the files in a directory (like opening a folder).

ls -al – Shows all files, including hidden ones, with detailed info.
ls /var/log – Lists files inside the /var/log directory.
🔹 pwd – Stands for "print working directory," showing where you are in the system.

🔹 cd Desktop – Moves into the Desktop folder.

cd ~ – Takes you back to the home directory.
🔹 history – Shows a list of all the commands you've used before.

2️⃣ Creating & Viewing Files
🔹 touch file.txt – Creates a new, empty file named file.txt.
🔹 cat file.txt – Displays the contents of a file.
🔹 echo "Hello World!" > file.txt – Writes "Hello World!" into file.txt.

3️⃣ User & System Information
🔹 whoami – Tells you who you are (which user you’re logged in as).
🔹 who – Shows all users currently using the system.
🔹 w – Shows detailed information about all logged-in users.
🔹 uname – Displays information about the operating system.

uname -o – Shows the name of the OS.
uname -p – Shows the processor type.
uname -a – Shows all system information.
✅ To get help on any command, use:

man uname – Opens the manual for the uname command.
man whatis uname – Explains what the uname command does.
Windows Log Files
We also explored how Windows stores log files, which record events and errors on a computer.
📌 To find Windows log files:

Open This PC
Go to Local Disk (C:)
Open the Windows folder
Find the Logs folder
📌 Windows logs are useful for troubleshooting problems and tracking system activity.

Final Thoughts & Next Steps
Today’s class helped me understand how Linux works and how to navigate it using commands. I now know how to:
✅ Use basic Linux commands to move around files and directories.
✅ Find Windows log files for system troubleshooting.
✅ Use man commands to read Linux manuals and learn more.

Next Steps:
📌 Practice Linux commands daily to get comfortable with the CLI.
📌 Explore Windows log files on my computer to understand system activity.
📌 Continue learning from GeeksforGeeks to improve my Linux skills.

Today’s lesson gave me a strong foundation in Linux, and I’m excited to keep learning!
