Today, we had an exciting opportunity to visit Cox Inc. in Sandy Springs, GA. It was a great experience to see a real-world tech company in action and learn about the different technologies they use to keep their systems secure and running smoothly.

We were welcomed by Hadji Hicks and Grabiel. Hadji is a former student of the City of Refuge program, and it was inspiring to see how he transitioned from a student to a professional working at Cox Inc. He shared valuable insights about the tools and programs they use daily.

Hadji introduced us to three key programs that help Cox Inc. protect and manage its technology:

Microsoft Defender – This is like a security guard for computers and networks. It helps detect and stop viruses, hackers, and cyber threats before they cause damage.

Example: Imagine Microsoft Defender as a superhero standing at the door of your computer, blocking bad guys from sneaking in.

Microsoft Azure – This is a cloud computing platform that allows businesses to store data, run applications, and manage services over the internet instead of on physical computers.

Example: Think of Azure as a giant digital backpack where a company can keep all its files, tools, and programs safely and access them from anywhere.

Google Chronicle – A security analytics tool that helps companies track and investigate potential cybersecurity threats.

Example: Google Chronicle works like a detective, investigating unusual activity in a network to stop hackers before they cause harm.

The Cox Inc. campus was beautiful and peaceful, almost like a botanical garden. It felt like a wellness environment, designed to help employees feel comfortable and focused while working.

Tech Departments at Cox Inc.
I did some research and learned about different tech teams that help keep the company running smoothly:

TechHelp+ – Provides IT support and troubleshooting for employees.

TechHelp AV Solutions – Manages audio and video technology, such as conference room equipment and presentations.

TechHelp Solution Center – A support center for solving major IT problems.

Network Operations Center (NOC) – Monitors and maintains the company’s network to ensure everything stays connected and running.

ESOC (Enterprise Security Operations Center) – A team that focuses on cybersecurity, protecting the company from cyber threats.

This visit gave us a real-life look at how a major tech company operates and how professionals use advanced tools to keep systems secure and efficient. It was inspiring to see someone like Hadji, who was once in our shoes, now working in a top company. It showed us that with the right skills and dedication, we too can achieve great things in the tech industry.
