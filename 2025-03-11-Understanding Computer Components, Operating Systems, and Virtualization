Reflection on Today’s Class – Understanding Computer Components, Operating Systems, and Virtualization
Today’s class with Mr. Darryl Davis was packed with important topics related to motherboards, operating systems, virtualization, and the binary system. Below is a breakdown of what we covered, explained in a way that an 8th grader could understand.

Understanding the Motherboard & Its Components
A motherboard is like the nervous system of a computer. It connects and allows communication between all parts of the computer.

Key Components on the Motherboard:
CPU (Central Processing Unit) – This is the brain of the computer. It processes all the instructions and calculations needed to run programs.
Example: When you play a video game, the CPU decides what happens next based on your actions.

RAM (Random Access Memory) – This is the short-term memory of the computer. It helps the computer run programs quickly but forgets everything when the power is off.
Example: When you’re taking notes on a whiteboard, RAM is like the whiteboard before you erase it.

PCI & PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect & PCI Express) – These are slots where you can add extra components like graphics cards or Wi-Fi cards to improve the computer.
Example: If you want to play high-quality games, you can install a PCIe graphics card to make the images look better.

Storage (HDD, SSD, Hybrid Storage)
  HDD (Hard Disk Drive) – Uses spinning magnetic disks to store data. Slower but cheaper.
  SSD (Solid State Drive) – No moving parts, much faster. Used in modern laptops and phones.
  Hybrid Storage (SSHD) – A mix of both HDD and SSD.
  BIOS/UEFI (Basic Input Output System / Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) – A tiny program stored on the motherboard that helps the computer start up when you turn it on.
    Example: It’s like the ignition system in a car—without it, your car (computer) won’t start.
  NVMe M.2 (Non-Volatile Memory Express M.2) – A super-fast type of SSD that plugs directly into the motherboard.
    Example: If an HDD is like a bicycle and an SSD is a car, NVMe is a Formula 1 race car—extremely fast!

How Do Operating Systems Work?
An Operating System (OS) is like the boss of the computer. It manages all the hardware and allows us to use applications (like web browsers and games).

What Does an Operating System Do?
Acts as a bridge between the user and the computer hardware.
Allocates resources like CPU power and memory to different programs.
Manages files and security.
Types of Operating Systems:
Windows OS – Made by Microsoft, used in most personal computers.
MacOS – Used in Apple computers.
Linux – An open-source OS, used for servers and tech projects.
Android & iOS – Operating systems for mobile phones.

Goals of an OS:
  Convenience – Makes computers easy to use.
  Efficiency – Makes sure programs run smoothly.
  Both – A good OS balances convenience and efficiency.

Virtualization & Hypervisors
What is Virtualization?
  Virtualization is when a computer can run multiple operating systems at the same time using special software called a hypervisor.

Can a Windows Machine Host a Virtual Machine?
* Yes! A Windows computer can run a virtual machine using a hypervisor like VMware, VirtualBox, or Microsoft Hyper-V.

Types of Hypervisors:
Type 1 Hypervisor ("Bare Metal") – Runs directly on the computer hardware, making it faster and more efficient.
  Examples: Xen, VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM.
  Example: A school that wants to run multiple virtual classrooms on one powerful computer would use a Type 1 Hypervisor.

Type 2 Hypervisor ("Hosted") – Runs on top of another operating system, meaning it’s a little slower but easier to use.
  Examples: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, Parallels.
  Example: If you have a Windows laptop but need to run a Linux program, you can use VirtualBox (Type 2 Hypervisor) to create a virtual Linux computer inside your Windows system.

Advantages of Virtualization:
* Saves money – No need to buy multiple computers.
* Better management – Easier to organize and control servers.
* Isolation – If a virtual machine gets a virus, it won’t harm the main system.
* System backup & recovery – You can create snapshots of a virtual machine and restore it if something goes wrong.

Disadvantages of Virtualization:
* Security risks – If a hacker breaks into the host system, they might access all virtual machines.
* Compatibility issues – Some programs don’t work well in a virtual machine.
* License costs – Some hypervisors and operating systems require expensive licenses.

The Origin of UNIX & Linux
Unix was one of the first operating systems. It led to the creation of many modern OS like Linux, MacOS, and Android.
Multics & Unics – Early versions of Unix.
Linux – Created by Linus Torvalds, Linux is an open-source OS that is used everywhere, from phones to supercomputers.

Understanding Binary, ASCII & The Language of Computers
  Binary System (0s and 1s)
  Computers don’t understand words like humans. Instead, they use binary code, which is just 0s and 1s.
   Example: The letter A in binary is 01000001.

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
  ASCII is a code that converts letters into numbers so computers can understand them.
    Example: The letter A = 65 in ASCII.

Why is Binary Important? It helps computers process and store data.
Everything you see on a screen—text, images, videos—is converted into binary for the computer to understand.
Final Thoughts & Next Steps

Today’s class covered a lot of technical concepts, but breaking them down into simple explanations makes them easier to understand.

Next Steps:
*  Watch more videos on binary and operating systems to deepen understanding.
* Experiment with Virtual Machines (Try VirtualBox or Hyper-V).
* Review the difference between Type 1 & Type 2 Hypervisors.
* Practice explaining these concepts to someone else.

Understanding how computers work is a key step toward a career in IT or cybersecurity. Today’s class gave me a solid foundation to build on.
