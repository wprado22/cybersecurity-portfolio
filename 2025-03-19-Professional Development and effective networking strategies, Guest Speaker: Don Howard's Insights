Reflection on Today's Professional Development Session

Today's class at the City of Refuge Cybersecurity Professional Program in Atlanta was both insightful and practical, focusing on professional development and effective networking strategies.

Guest Speaker: Don Howard's Insights

We had the privilege of hearing from Don Howard, a former City of Refuge student, who shared valuable tips for navigating the first 90 days in a new job. His advice included:

Building Relationships: Don emphasized the importance of getting to know team members by scheduling 15-minute meetings with each. This approach helps in understanding team dynamics and fosters collaboration.

Taking Notes and Maintaining a To-Do List: Organizing tasks and responsibilities ensures that nothing is overlooked and demonstrates reliability.

Shadowing Team Members: Observing colleagues provides practical insights into workflows and best practices, facilitating a smoother transition into new roles.

These strategies align with recommendations from career experts, who suggest that building relationships and understanding one's environment are crucial during the initial employment period.

Networking Best Practices and Role-Playing

In addition to Don's talk, we engaged in activities led by Primous and J.W. that focused on networking best practices and role-playing exercises:

Making Meaningful Connections: We practiced initiating conversations and maintaining engagement, essential skills for professional networking.

Role-Playing Scenarios: Simulating real-life networking situations allowed us to refine our communication techniques in a supportive environment.

Role-playing is recognized as an effective method to enhance networking skills, as it allows individuals to practice and receive feedback in a controlled setting.
