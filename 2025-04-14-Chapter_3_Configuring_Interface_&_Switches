Today in class, we reviewed what we learned in the last lesson.

We Reviewed types of cables:
Three main types of cables that connect computers and help send information:

Twisted Pair Cables – These are the most common. They have wires twisted around each other to stop interference.

There are two types:

UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) – has no extra covering.

STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) – has a shield to protect the signal.

We also saw VTP (Virtual Trunk Protocol), which is used more in network setups with switches.

Coaxial Cables – These have a single wire in the middle and are covered with insulation and shielding. They're good at sending signals long distances.

Fiber Optic Cables – These use light to send data and are super fast! They're great for long distances and have less chance of interference.

Wireless Networks use antennas to send signals through the air. This is how Wi-Fi works!

Network devices that help send and boost signals;

Media Converter – Changes one type of connection to another, like fiber to twisted pair.

Amplifier – Makes signals stronger, especially over long distances.

Repeater – Copies the signal and sends it again to keep it strong.

Hub – A simple device that connects multiple computers, but it sends data to all of them (not very smart!).

Data Link Layer & MAC Address which is part of how computers send data in small packets.

Each device has a special number called a MAC Address (like a name tag), so the network knows where to send the data.
