About Me:

Willian Fernandes do Prado,

Atlanta, Georgia, USA

Case Management and Data Entry.

My background combines experience in case management and data entry with a growing expertise in IT, particularly in data security. As a paralegal, I managed sensitive client information, maintained organized case files, and ensured accurate data entry within legal databases. This experience developed my attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and ability to handle confidential information securely.

In my transition to IT, I have pursued industry-recognized certifications such as the Google IT Support Professional Certificate and CompTIA A+ preparation. These have provided me with hands-on experience in troubleshooting, network fundamentals, system administration, and cybersecurity concepts. I am particularly drawn to IT because of its dynamic nature and the opportunity to safeguard digital assets against cyber threats.

My goal is to build a strong foundation in IT by gaining hands-on experience as a Data Center Technician, focusing on IT infrastructure, hardware maintenance, and networking. I am particularly passionate about cybersecurity and committed to expanding my expertise in this field. To achieve this, I plan to attend the City of Refuge Technical Program, where I will develop practical skills in cybersecurity, including threat detection, network security, and risk management. Upon completing the program, my goal is to secure a cybersecurity-related role where I can apply my knowledge to protect digital assets and contribute to a secure IT environment.
