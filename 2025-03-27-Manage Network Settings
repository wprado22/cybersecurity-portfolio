​In today's Network Fundamentals class, we delved deeper into managing network settings and explored several key concepts and tools. Here's a summary of the topics we covered:​

DHCP Server: This is like a librarian who assigns unique library card numbers (IP addresses) to each student (device) so they can borrow books (access the network).​

IP Addresses: These are unique identifiers for devices on a network, similar to home addresses.​

IPv4 and IPv6: These are two versions of IP addresses. IPv4 uses a 32-bit address system (like a 4-digit house number), while IPv6 uses a 128-bit system (like a much longer house number) to accommodate more devices.​

Subnet: This divides a large network into smaller, manageable sections, like dividing a city into neighborhoods.​

Default Gateway: This acts as the main exit and entry point of a network, like the main gate of a school.​

DNS Server (Domain Name System): This translates website names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses, similar to how a phonebook matches names to phone numbers.​

New Topics Covered:

DNS Client: This is the part of your computer that queries the DNS server to find the IP address associated with a website name.​

Difference Between DHCP and DNS:

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.​
Tenable Documentation

DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names into IP addresses.​

Ping and Traceroute Commands:

Ping: A tool used to test if a device is reachable on the network. For example, typing ping www.google.com checks if Google's server is accessible.​

Traceroute: Shows the path data takes to reach its destination, helping identify where connection issues might occur.​

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Translates IP addresses to MAC addresses (the unique hardware address of a device), like matching a car's license plate to its VIN number.​

MAC Address: A unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. It's like a fingerprint for your device.​

Troubleshooting Models:

Gather Information: Collect details about the issue.​

Identify What Has Changed: Determine if anything was altered recently.​

Create a Hypothesis: Guess what might be causing the problem.​
Youtube 

Determine the Appropriate Fix: Decide on a solution.​

Implement the Fix: Apply the solution.​

Ensure User Satisfaction: Confirm that the issue is resolved.​

Document the Solution: Record what was done for future reference.​

System and Service Administration:

Process: A running instance of a program.​

Daemon: A background process that runs without user interaction.​

Service: A program that runs in the background and provides functionalities to other programs or users.​

Linux Boot Process:

BIOS/UEFI: Initial firmware that starts the computer.​
Tenable Documentation

Boot Loader: Loads the operating system into memory.​

Kernel: The core of the operating system.​

Systemd or SysVinit: Manages system processes after the kernel is loaded.​

Systemctl Commands:

Starts a service.​

Stops a service.​

Checks the status of a service.​

Scheduling Tasks Using Cron Service:

Cron: A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems.​

Crontab: A file containing commands to be run at specified times.​

Installing and Managing Services in Linux:

Installing Apache Web Server:

sudo apt install apache2: Installs the Apache web server.

ping -c 10 [IP address]: Sends 10 ping requests to the specified IP address.

Installing Nessus Essentials:

Download Nessus: Visit the Tenable website and download the Nessus Essentials package suitable for your operating system.​
YouTube

Install Nessus: Use the appropriate command to install the downloaded package. For example, on Ubuntu:​

sudo dpkg -i Nessus-<version number>-debian6_amd64.deb

www.tenable.com/download via the ubutun webbrowser.

cd download/ 

Start Nessus Service: After installation, start the Nessus service:​

sudo systemctl start nessusd

Access Nessus Web Interface: Open a web browser and navigate to https://localhost:8834/ to complete the setup.​
