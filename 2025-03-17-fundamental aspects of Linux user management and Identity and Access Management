In today's class, we delved into several fundamental aspects of Linux user management and Identity Access Management (IAM). Here's a reflection on the topics covered, presented in a manner suitable for an 8th grader, along with definitions and examples to enhance understanding.

1. Installing CentOS on VMware

We began by installing CentOS, a popular Linux distribution, on VMware, which is a software that allows us to run multiple operating systems on a single computer. This setup is called a virtual machine. Imagine your computer as a house, and VMware lets you create separate rooms (virtual machines) where each room can have its own operating system, like CentOS.

2. Advanced File System Navigation

Once CentOS was installed, we explored advanced ways to navigate and manage files within the Linux file system using various commands:

grep: This command helps search for specific text within files. For example, grep cor1 /etc/passwd searches for the term "cor1" in the /etc/passwd file.

Pipe (|): The pipe symbol allows us to use the output of one command as the input for another. For instance, ls -l | wc -l lists all files in a directory and then counts them.

wc: Stands for "word count." It counts lines, words, and characters in a file. For example, wc -l filename counts the number of lines in "filename."

tr: Used to translate or delete characters. For example, tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' converts lowercase letters to uppercase.

find: Searches for files and directories. For example, find /home -name "*.txt" searches for all text files in the /home directory.

touch: Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file. For example, touch newfile.txt creates a new file named "newfile.txt."

nano: A simple text editor used to create or edit files directly from the terminal.

3. User Management and Identity and Access Management (IAM)

We discussed how Linux manages users and the broader concept of IAM:

Identity: This is who you are in the system, like your username.

Authentication: Proving you are who you say you are, typically by entering a password.

Authorization: Determines what you're allowed to do after you're authenticated, like accessing certain files or running specific programs.

Accounting: Keeping track of what users do on the system, such as logging which files they accessed.

In Linux, user information is stored in files like /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. The /etc/passwd file contains user account information, while /etc/shadow holds encrypted password data. Commands like cat /etc/passwd | grep nologin allow us to view users who are not permitted to log in.

4. User Management Commands

We learned several commands to manage users in Linux:

useradd: Creates a new user. For example, sudo useradd mjackson adds a user named "mjackson."

passwd: Sets or changes a user's password. For example, sudo passwd mjackson sets the password for "mjackson."

usermod: Modifies a user's account details. For example, sudo usermod -c "Michael Jackson" mjackson adds a comment to the user's profile.

userdel: Deletes a user account. For example, sudo userdel -r mjackson removes the user "mjackson" and their home directory.

5. Privilege Escalation

We also touched upon the concept of privilege escalation, which means gaining higher access rights than originally granted. In Linux, the sudo command allows permitted users to execute commands as the superuser or another user, providing necessary administrative privileges.

6. Upcoming Topics

Reflection

Today's class provided a deeper understanding of Linux's user management and the importance of IAM in maintaining system security. Learning to navigate the file system and manage users equips us with essential skills for system administration. The hands-on experience with commands like grep, find, and nano enhances our ability to interact effectively with the system.

As we progress, these foundational skills will be crucial for managing more complex tasks and ensuring secure and efficient system operations.
